/**
 * ID resolver.
 *
 * Resolves specification, and thus object, identifiers.  The identifier is
 * resolved to itself, allowing `@require` annotations to directly declare
 * required objects by ID.  Identifers must consist solely of alpha-numeric
 * characters, as well as "." or "_" or "-" characters.
 *
 * This is the only resolver built into Electrolyte.  It is expected that
 * higher-level frameworks will add support for resolving interfaces to
 * objects.  Such extensions should mandate the use of a character that is
 * otherwise not valid in an identifer, in order to disambiguate.  For example,
 * this can be done by using URLs, which must include a ":" character.
 *
 * @return {function}
 * @public
