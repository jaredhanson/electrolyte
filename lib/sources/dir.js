/**
 * Sources objects from a directory.
 *
 * This source allows objects located in a directory on the file system to be
 * created and injected as dependencies.
 *
 * This directory typically contains application-specific objects such as
 * proprietary classes and non-standardized endpoints.
 *
 * Over the course of developing an application, it is normal for objects to
 * start out as application-specific.  After successive iterations, it is common
 * for these objects to be factored into reusable classes with well-defined
 * interfaces.  When that occurs, it is recommended for such classes to be
 * extracted from the application and packaged in a stand-alone source.  For
 * example, Bixby.js provides a suite of sources that are commonly required when
 * developing cloud services.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *    IoC.use(IoC.dir('app'));
 *
 * @return {function}
 * @public
